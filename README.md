# python-hangman
This is the hangman game.

The person is drawn in 6 parts (for 6 letter guesses) in the order: head, body, left leg, right leg, left arm, right arm.
For each wrong guess, one body part is drawn as mentioned above.
If all the body parts have been drawn and you've still not guessed the entire word correctly, you lose.
However, if you guess all the right letters that make the answer word before all the afore mentioned body parts are drawn, you win.
Enjoy the game!
